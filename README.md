## Goal
The main goal of this project is to predict the sale prices for houses in the test set based on the provided features. The project explores different regression techniques, including linear regression, polynomial regression, and neural network models.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
